### Billiards Simulation
- Python simulation of a pool game, created using the PyGame library.
- Handles ball-ball and ball-rail linear collisions and friction from the table surface.
- Pocket collisions remove balls from the table.

### Controls
- Hit spacebar to fire cue ball toward mouse position, at a velocity proportional to your mouse's distance from the cue ball.
- Hit r key to reset the simulation.

### Running
- In a terminal: ```python3 SimTest.py```
